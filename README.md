Code for my PhD Thesis 

"ErlangB.m" is the Matlab code of Erlang B formula, which defines the Erlang B function can be invoked by other programs

"New_analytical.m" is the code using Erlang B formula to derived the analytical result. Here, we assume the total 
traffic load is 10 Erlang, in which Class 1 traffic owns the highest priority, and it take 40% of the total traffic, Class 2
owns the second priority, it takes 50% of the total traffic, and Class 3 is the lowest priority, it takes the remaining 10% 
traffic. This program output the calculating result to the console, it plots the result as well.

"New_Markov_CI" uses a Markov chain to simulate the evolution of the blocking probability as the bandwidth (channel) increases.
